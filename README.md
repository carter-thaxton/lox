This is an implementation of the `lox` programming language, as described in https://craftinginterpreters.com/

This project was intially used to implement the [CodeCrafters - Build Your Own Interpreter](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/interpreter/overview) challenge.
After completing the challenge, I continued to implement more of the book.

This project also includes a copy of the tests from the [craftinginterpreters book repository](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/master/test).
